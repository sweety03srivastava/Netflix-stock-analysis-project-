# Netflix-stock-analysis-project-
In the Netflix stock analysis project, I examined stock trading volume, daily high, open, and close prices, and analyzed trends on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. The project identified the top 5 dates with the highest and lowest stock prices, providing insights into significant market movements.

The primary objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's stock, focusing on the following aspects:

Volume of Stock Traded: Analyze the volume of Netflix stock traded over time to identify trends and significant changes.
Stock Price Metrics: Examine the stock price's daily high, open, and close values.
Time-Based Analysis: Analyze the stock price on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis to understand seasonal trends and overall performance.
Top 5 Dates with Highest Stock Price: Identify the top 5 dates with the highest stock prices.
Top 5 Dates with Lowest Stock Price: Identify the top 5 dates with the lowest stock prices.
